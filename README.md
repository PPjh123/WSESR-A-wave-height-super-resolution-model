# WSESR-super-resolution-for-wave-height
A lightweight wave height super-resolution model based on wavelet transform and deep learning

The low-resolution wave height data are gathered from the public dataset ERA5: https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets

The high-resolution wave height data are gathered from the public dataset Global Ocean Waves Analysis and Forecast of Copernicus Marine Data Store: https://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00017

The baselines models can be deployed from the following code repositories:
